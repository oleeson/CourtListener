This is where we might output stored models, visualizations of profiled data, etc.

We also try to log things metadata about those work products (when they were created, which
dataset/version supported the visualizations, etc). Through logging we essentially
build in a citation. If a consumer of our work ever asks "how do you know this is true" or
"where did you get this from", we have it logged away.
